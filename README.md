# Overview
This repository implements the methods described in Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters" found at https://craftinginterpreters.com/

## Notes
This repository is for my own learning purposes, but it seemed worthwhile to publish my efforts as I go along. I will attempt to be thorough in documenting things as I go along and make any changes to this readme as I think they would be useful to either myself or someone else reviewing this repository.
