# Overview
This repository implements the lox language as described in Robert Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters" found at https://craftinginterpreters.com/

## Notes
This repository is for my own learning purposes, but it seemed worthwhile to publish my efforts as I go along. I will attempt to be thorough in documenting things as I go along and make any changes to this readme as I think they would be useful to either myself or someone else reviewing this repository.

To start off, I had to follow instructions for setting up dart (https://dart.dev/get-dart#install) with version 2.19.6 in order for the provided code found at https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters to work correctly. I used brew to install dart and had to update my .zshrc to be able to point to it correctly.
